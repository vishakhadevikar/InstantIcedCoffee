  <h2>Instant Iced Coffee</h2>
  <p>
		<b>Ingredients</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Â¾ tablespoon (14 grams) instant coffee</li>
			<li>5 to 6 tablespoons (75 to 90 milliliters) hot water</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon (15 grams) sugar</li>
			<li>Ice (to taste)</li>
			<li>Creamer, half-and-half, or milk (to taste)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Making Instant Coffee</b>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Fill a tall glass with instant coffee and sugar.</b>- You are adding the sugar with the instant coffee, because it dissolves better in hot
				water than in cold. If you like your iced coffee less sweet, use less sugar.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Stir in the hot water</b>. Boil the water first, then add it to the instant coffee-sugar mixture. Keep stirring until the sugar and
				instant coffee dissolve. Don't worry if your coffee looks strong. It will become less strong once you add the ice in.
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use less water for a stronger coffee, and more water for a weaker coffee. Keep in mind that the coffee will become even weaker once you add the ice..</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Add in a few ice cubes and stir</b>. Don't worry if the ice melts; it most certainly will from the hot coffee. These first few ice cubes
				will dilute the strong coffee mixture and help cool it down initially.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add in the rest of the ice cubes. You can add as many or as few cubes as you'd like. This ice is what will make your coffee nice, cold, and icy.
				<ul><li>For a lightly-iced coffee, plop in a few cubes. For a regular iced coffee, fill the glass almost to the top. The ice will melt quickly at first, but it will slow down once the coffee becomes cold.</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Top off with a splash of cream, half-and-half, or milk</b>. If you'll like a lighter iced coffee, you can also add some cold water. Give the coffee a final stir to mix in the creamer.</li>

			<li><b>Enjoy your iced coffee before the ice melts.</b> The longer you wait, the more watery your iced coffee will become.</li>
		</ul>
